########################  Obtaining and compiling #######################

Download https://svnemc.ncep.noaa.gov/projects/nmmb_init/trunk/NMMB_init from the EMC code repository.

The NMMB_init directory contains the NPS software, a controlling job 
script, and loadleveler jobs that get submitted by the controlling script.

Once you have obtained this directory, go into the NPS subdirectory.

0)  Issue a "conf $mach" command, where $mach is either wcoss or zeus

1)  Enter ./configure which will produce a menu that begins

   1.  PC Linux x86_64 (zeus), Intel(ifort) compiler, DM parallel
   2.  PC Linux x86_64 (wcoss), Intel(ifort) compiler, DM parallel
   3.  PC Linux x86_64 (wcoss), GNU(gfortran) compiler, DM parallel, stillnotworking
   4.  PC Linux x86_64 (wcoss), Intel(ifort) compiler, serial

Use option 1 if on Zeus, and option 2 if on WCOSS.  Options 3 and 4 are works in progress
at the moment

2)  ./compile

This should build all four of the NPS programs.  This includes those with 
the same names as the standard E-grid WPS (geogrid.exe, ungrib.exe, 
metgrid.exe) and also the new NEMS-specific program nemsinterp.exe.  
The nemsinterp.exe program replaces the functionality of the WRF-based 
real_nmm.exe program:  vertical interpolation onto the hybrid vertical 
coordinate, and generation of the input and lateral boundary condition 
files used by the forecast model.

If all goes well with the build, these five executables should be linked 
into the NPS directory:

geogrid.exe     metgrid.exe     nemsinterp.exe  ungrib.exe ungribp.exe

########################   How to use  ##################

3) Go up one directory to the main NMMB_init directory (if not already
there from step 2b) and edit the build_namelists.scr script
that specifies details of the model domain.  The defining variables
are grouped into several main blocks.

a)  Machine selection 

WCOSS and ZEUS are the fully supported options; others will require
some slight editing (mimicing what is done for the WCOSS=1 and ZEUS=1 options)

The "ptmp" space is widely used with NPS on WCOSS/ZEUS.  On WCOSS the ptmp is split
across three different filesets, with different users on different disks, so which ptmp is a settable option.

b)  Select global or regional

Set with the binary (0/1) "global" variable, which in turn defines a 
logical variable log_glob.  99% of development and testing has been done 
with the regional option, and I recommend that choice for initial 
attempts at using this package.

c)  Specify the start_* and end_* times, and the length of the forecast 
model run.

Note that for the global model case, the start and end times can be the 
same, with run_hr settable to any value.  In the regional case,  the 
start_* and end_* times define the time period over which the lateral 
boundaries will be defined, and the difference between them sets an upper 
limit on run_hr.

d)  Specify domain dimensions, grid spacing

num_domains specifies how many total domains, including the parent.  
The default system has crude support for two nests if desired.

nx, ny, and nz define the dimensions.  At least for regional domains, 
these are the true dimensions and not any "+1" dimensions as was done in 
the WRF.

Dimensions for nest1 and nest2 are specified, along with spacing ratios.

dx and dy are the grid spacings along the x- and y-axes in degrees of 
longitude and latitude.  For the same effective grid spacing, the dx and 
dy values on the B-grid are roughly sqrt(2) larger than the dx and dy
values on the E-grid.

e)  Specify domain location (center of domain) - west longitude is negative

f)  Specify vertical coordinate details and miscellaneous items

PTOP, PTSGM:  These define the model top pressure, and the approximate 
pressure of the sigma - isobaric interface within the hybrid coordinate.
Both are specified in Pa (i.e., PTOP=5000. is 50 hPa is 50 mb).

levels:  An optional specification of the non-dimensional interface 
values specifying the vertical coordinate.  If not specified, the code 
will generate a reasonable vertical coordinate based on the number of 
vertical levels.  NOTE:   for the values to properly be inserted into 
the appropriate namelist, they must be listed as one continuous line with 
no spaces ranging from 0 to 1.  Also, for a model run with nz levels, there should be nz+1 
interface values specified here.

VCOORD_OPT: 0=original NMMB hybrid (obsolete), 1="vc", 2=GFS, 3="sal".  Must be 
between 1 and 3 to use with current model code.

nproc_*:  Specifies task counts for each of the programs

SRC_GRIB:  GFS and NAM are the major entries.  Used by the code when 
DO_CLOUDS is true to decide what input cloud fields are available to
be vertically interpolated.

spectral:  logical specifying whether gridded data or GFS spectral
files are to be used.

direct_temp:  a logical switch specifying whether the temperature field 
is vertically interpolated from the source model temperatures 
(direct_temp = .true.) or is derived from the NMMB layer thicknesses 
(direct_temp=.false.)

NCEP_PROC, NCEP_PROC_GRIB2,  DO_GWD:   Logical variables specifying whether geogrid 
produced static fields will be replaced by their Gayno code equivalents 
(NCEP_PROC), and whether the additional GWD fields are desired in the 
model input file (DO_GWD).  Setting NCEP_PROC to .true. is strongly
recommended.  NCEP_PROC_GRIB2 writes the intermediate files as GRIB2, and needs
to be true for moving nests.

moving_nests:  Logical variable specifying whether full domain fields at nest
resolution need to be created.  If true, NCEP_PROC_GRIB2 must also be true.
   
DO_CLOUDS:  Logical variable telling whether initial cloud fields should
be produced or not.  Requires use of NAM grid 221 or GFS data.

USE_IGBP:  If set to 1, the IGBP land classes will be utilized.  If 0, the older, USGS land classes
are used.

5)  Specify the paths for PACKROOT (holding location for scripts, tables, namelists), and 
WORKROOT (where the NPS will run).  The defaults should be fine on WCOSS or
ZEUS, but can be tailored to the users' needs.  

6)  Run the intialization codes by run executing the build_namelists.scr 
script, which will fill values into namelists and submit the  
job to run.  Assuming a regional initialization, the WORKDIR path should end up 
with a input_domain_01 file (initial conditions), and a set 
of boco.XXXX files (boundary condition files, XXXX is the forecast hour 
of the beginning of the period for which the boundary tendencies are 
valid).  It also will produce a nemsio version of the input file 
(input_domain_01_nemsio).  If running with nests, input_domain_xx and
input_domain_xx_nemsio files also will be produced.
