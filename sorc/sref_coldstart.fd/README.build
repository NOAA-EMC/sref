Instructions for building and installing emcsfc_coldstart:

1) Invoke the 'make.sh' driver script from the command line:

   "make.sh"

The "make.sh" driver script loads modules (for the compiler and NCEPLIBS)
and exports environment variables required by the makefile.  It then
invokes the makefile.

If the program is successfully built, it will be installed
in the ../../exec directory.

Only tested on Zeus and the NCEP WCOSS machine.
